                    <br />
                    Throughout my life, Iâ€™ve traveled the world, met incredible people, performed live
                    music
                    in front of large crowds, and enjoyed foods from many different cultures.

                    {/* Throughout my life, I swam in the Dead Sea, met a Holocaust survivor, performed electronic DJ sets in
                    front of large crowds, ate live octopus in Korea, and lived in a five person apartment in Brooklyn, NY. */}
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    All of these experiences share one constant in my life that never falters:
                    I'm motivated by sharing meaningful experiences with everyone in the world. I want to develop
                    applications
                    that can help people within their daily lives.
